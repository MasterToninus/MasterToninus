#### :microscope: Research Interests  
My work focuses on the intersection of *differential geometry*, *higher structures*, and *mathematical physics*.  
I am particularly interested in:  
- **Multisymplectic manifolds**,  
- **Symmetries** in geometry and physics, and  
- **Algebraic structures up to homotopy**, with a broad and interdisciplinary perspective.  

---

#### :computer: Technical Skills  
I have foundational[^1] experience in:  
- **Object-oriented programming** (*C++, Java*), and  
- **High-performance computing** (*CUDA*).  

---

#### :seedling: Side Projects  
I plan to dive into *Haskell* and explore its applications to *(higher) category theory*.

#### :mailbox: Get in Touch  
- **Website**: [www.antoniomiti.it](https://www.antoniomiti.it/)  
- **Job Market**: I will be available starting **February 2026**.
