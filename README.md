### Hi there :suspect:
I'm an MSCA postdoctoral fellow at the [Universit√† di Roma "la Sapienza"](https://dipartimenti.unicatt.it/dmf](https://www.mat.uniroma1.it/persone/miti) in Rome, Italy.\
My research project is founded by the [CIVIS3i](https://civis3i.univ-amu.fr/en/antonio-michele-miti) H2020-cofund.\

- :microscope: My research interests are at the intersection of *differential geometry*, *higher structures*, and *mathematical physics*. 
In particular, I am interested in *multisymplectic manifolds*, *symmetries* and *algebraic structures up to homotopy* in the broad sense.

- :computer: Coding-wise, I have a tiny[^1] experience in *object-oriented* 
programming languages *(C++, Java)* and high-performance computing *(Cuda)*.

- :seedling: I cultivate the wishful side-project of learning *Haskell* in conjunction with *(higher) category theory*.

- :mailbox: How to reach me: [dmf.unicatt.it/miti/](https://dmf.unicatt.it/miti/)

- :dart: I will be on the job market from February 2026.
