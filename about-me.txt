      <!-- My Story: cover Letter -->
      <p class="lead">

        My name is Antonio Michele Miti,
        I  have recently gained a master degree in Physics at the University of Milano
        and I am currently looking for a PhD scholarship in Mathematical Physics.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Specifically , my interests revolve around the axiomatic theory and mathematical foundations of classical and quantum field theories.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Despite my academic training take place within the degree course in Physics my preparation was dedicated as much as possible to mathematical methods and modern mathematical physics.
        I have been interested in mathematical physics since I was an undergraduate where I attended several courses held by the mathematical physics group of Bicocca University,
        that led me to take a bachelor thesis in geometric mechanics with professor Franco Magri who deeply influenced my approach towards theoretical physics.

    The necessity to broaden my mathematical expertise pushed me to change university from Milano-Bicocca to Milano-Statale.
    During my master's studies, in addition to the exams I have taken, I
    attended several extra courses both in mathematics and in theoretical physics.
    Also the mandatory laboratory activities were oriented towards abstraction, being dedicated to computational physics and low-level programming.
    In addition I had the opportunity to work, for about eight months, in a computer lab as a student collaborator.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    The same need for a mathematically rigourous approach to physics encouraged me to look for a external master's thesis at  Pavia University.
    There I had the opportunity to be introduced to the topic of quantum field theory on curved background
    by my master's thesis advisor Claudio Dappiaggi, one of the leading italian researchers this field.
    During this period I was able to get an overview of the fundamental mathematical topics in AQFT,
    which are fairly advanced with respect to the common undergraduate courses,
    and I had the chance to study the algebraic quantization scheme.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    My last scientific work is my master's thesis.
    It focused on the formalization of the construction algorithm of Peierls brackets and their role in the quantization scheme
    It proposes a geometric interpretation in connection with the quantized Jacobi Field.
